Social Tracer is a social tracing application to be used in opportunistic networking. Its purpose is to gather data about the social interactions of individuals. This is done through an Android application that uses a device's Bluetooth to periodically scan for other devices in range.

This is a project done at the Politehnica University of Bucharest, and will be used for an experiment that tracks the social behavior of the students at the university for a 40-day period. The goal is to gather traces similar to the ones from [CRAWDAD](http://crawdad.org/data.php) that can later be used as input to an opportunistic networking data dissemination algorithm.
